> THis is the main folder where the work will be done. See notezPanty

# Main Docs

[`https://create-react-app.dev/`](https://create-react-app.dev/)

- CRA is for creating a simple react app
- This is the main docs
- This is different from [`https://react.dev/`](https://react.dev/), which is hub

## Official Installation with `typescript TS`

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

- This method appears to be working..

# Using `bun`

```sh
bunx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

- This method finally works the issue was you didnt see the latest docs which required the `--tepmplate` keyword to run the TS version
